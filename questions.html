<p>You've been selected for Supercell Data Scientist pre-screening. Please solve the following tasks.</p>
<p>We'd prefer that you use <code>R</code> and <code>SQLite3</code>, but you may also use <code>Python</code>, <code>Excel</code> or other generally used toolkits you consider suitable for industry use.</p>
<p>The best ways to access a <code>SQLite3</code> database is the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html">RSQLite</a> package in <code>R</code> or the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html">sqlite3</a> command line interface.</p>
<p>Please return your solutions as a <code>PDF</code> file to datascience-prescreen@supercell.net and attach all your code and plots. Please send your plots in PDF or PNG format.</p>
<h1 id="task-1.-how-does-the-revenue-trickle">Task 1. How does the revenue trickle?</h1>
<p>You've received a SQLite3 database <code>tasks.sqlite</code> as an attachment.</p>
<p>The database contains three tables: <code>account</code>, <code>account_device</code> and <code>transactions</code>. <code>account</code> contains user profiles, <code>account_device</code> their devices and <code>transactions</code> contains in-app purchases.</p>
<ul>
<li>How much revenue was produced on 2013-02-01?</li>
<li>Are there any users who use both iPads and iPhones?</li>
<li>Which country produces the most revenue?</li>
<li>What is the iPad/iPhone split in Canada?</li>
<li>What proportion of lifetime revenue is generated on the player's first week in game?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe the data weâ€™ve provided is not sufficient for a task, please outline your concerns in your report with suggestions.</p>
<p>Feel free to use any tools you deem necessary, including tables and plots.</p>
<h1 id="task-2.-visualise-this">Task 2. Visualise this!</h1>
<p>Please visualise a single aspect of the data you find important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you choose this particular visualisation?</li>
<li>What would you improve in your visualisation?</li>
<li>What would be your conclusions and recommendations to the game team based on this visualisation?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="task-3.-patterns">Task 3. Patterns?</h1>
<p>Please apply a suitable machine learning technique to the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you choose this particular technique?</li>
<li>What would you improve in your model?</li>
<li>What would be your conclusions and recommendations to the game team based on this model?</li>
